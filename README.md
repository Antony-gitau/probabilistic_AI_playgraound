# Probabilistic AI playground

Learning and implementing probabilistic machine learning tasks using tools like Pyro and PyTorch following [ProbAI 2022](https://github.com/probabilisticai/probai-2022) & [2023](https://github.com/probabilisticai/probai-2023) and other resources.

Currently working on the [ProbAI 2023 assignment](https://github.com/probabilisticai/dt8122-2023) for an unofficial submission of [DT8122 course](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/DT8122#tab=omEmnet).
